# Autonomous Rover Research

## Getting Started
There are a few things that need to be installed to run this project, with the main ones being [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and [Gazebo Classic](https://classic.gazebosim.org)

To ensure a consistent environment for this project, we use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This is also the operating system that ROS 2 Humble targets.

There are several ways of setting up your development environment, such as using a lightweight Linux virtual machine (WSL on Windows or RoboStack on macOS), or using the native operating system.

Please follow [Setting up your development environment - Windows & Linux](/docs/dev-setup-windows-linux.md) or [Setting up your development environment - macOS](/docs/dev-setup-macos.md) depending on your operating system.
